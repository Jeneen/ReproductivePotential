Fish fecundity scales hyperallometrically with body mass,  meaning larger females produce disproportionately more eggs than smaller ones. We explore this relationship beyond the species-level to estimate the “reproductive potential” of 1,632 coral reef sites distributed globally. We find that, at the site-level, reproductive potential scales hyperallometrically with assemblage biomass, but with a median exponent of 1.08, rather than the averaged species exponent of 1.19. For the family Serranidae, modelled reproductive potential was 656% higher in fully protected sites versus fished sites, while across all families, this difference was 209%. When comparing a scenario where 30% of sites were randomly fully protected to a current protection scenario, we estimate an increase of up to 155% in reproductive potential for Serranidae, and 31% across families. Such results point to the possible ecological benefits  of the 30x30 global conservation target and showcase management options to promote the sustainability of population replenishment.
